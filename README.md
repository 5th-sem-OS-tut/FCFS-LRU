_What is FCFS scheduling algorithm?_

**First Come First Serve** (FCFS) is an operating system scheduling algorithm that
automatically executes queued requests and processes in order of their arrival. It is the
easiest and simplest CPU scheduling algorithm. In this type of algorithm, processes
which requests the CPU first get the CPU allocation first. This is managed with a
FIFO queue.

_What is LRU Page Replacement Algorithm?_

This algorithm stands for "**Least Recently Used**" and this algorithm helps the
operating system to search those pages that are used over a short duration of time
frame. It works on the concept that pages that have been highly used in the past are
likely to be significantly used again in the future. It removes the page that has not
been utilized in the memory for the longest time.
